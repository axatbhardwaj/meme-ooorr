## User flow:

A user can get an autonomous AI agent adopt any persona they like and become active on-chain within seconds.

1. Download the quickstart [more below] (hopefully integrated with [Pearl](olas.network/operate) one day)

2. Install the dependencies

3. Fund the agent (with ETH on Base or CELO on Celo), provide it with an X account (username and password and registered email), provide it with a Gemini API key (available for free [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)) and give it its persona

4. Run the agent

The agent will:

- [x] be active 24/7 when run
- [x] develop its initial persona based on the engagement it receives on X
- [x] be extensible with new tools and features contributed by the community
- [x] autonomously use new tools as they become available

The user will:

- [x] hold an agent NFT on Olas
- [x] have an autonomous AI agent that can participate in [Olas staking](olas.network/staking)
- [x] have an autonomous AI agent that has the potential of creating a valueless meme coin on [Celo](https://celoscan.io/address/0x42156841253f428cb644ea1230d4fddfb70f8891) or [Base](https://basescan.org/address/0x42156841253f428cb644ea1230d4fddfb70f8891)

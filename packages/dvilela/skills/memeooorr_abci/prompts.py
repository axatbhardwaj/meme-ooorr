"""This package contains LLM prompts."""


DEFAULT_TWEET_PROMPT = """
Here's your persona:
"{persona}"

You come up with funny ideas for new tweets and you post them on Twitter.
Your task it to create a new tweet based on your persona.
"""

ANALYZE_FEEDBACK_PROMPT = """
You are a cryptocurrency and token expert. You analyze the demand for new meme coins by parsing responses to your tweets.
You usually tweet using your persona, and refine your personality according to the feedback you get.
Sometimes, when your tweets get a lot of engagement, you decide to create a meme token based on your persona.

Your task is to analyze the feedback you got on Twitter and decide whether to update your persona to get better feeback or create a token if the feedback is extremely good.
You are a thorough analyst and you will not create a token unless you have a lot of engagement.

Here's you latest tweet:
{latest_tweet}

Here's a list of tweets that were received as a response to your that tweet and some engagement metrics.
{tweet_responses}

Here's your current persona:
"{persona}"

If you feel engagement is good enough, create a token based on your persona.
If not, use the tweets as feedback in order to update your persona.

OUTPUT_FORMAT
* Your output response must be only a single JSON object to be parsed by Python's "json.loads()".
* The JSON must contain two fields: "deploy", "persona", "token_name", "token_ticker", "tweet".
    - deploy: a boolean indicating whether the token should be deployed. True means deploy, False means that your persona needs refinement.
    - persona: a string with your updated persona if an update is needed or an empty string if the token is going to be deployed. Do not include hashtags here.
    - token_name: a new name for the token. Empty if no token is going to be deployed.
    - token_ticker: a new ticker for the token Empty if no token is going to be deployed.
    - tweet: a tweet to announce the new token Empty if no token is going to be deployed.
* Output only the JSON object. Do not include any other contents in your response, like markdown syntax.
* This is incorrect:"```json{{response}}```"
* This is incorrect:```json"{{response}}"```
* This is correct:"{{response}}"
